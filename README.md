My acm implementation

1. Start a new problem:

    $ ./new.sh $PROGRAM_NAME # ex: 100_3N_plus_1

    It will create a folder which has the following initial files:
        - main.cpp
        - Makefile

2. Start Coding:
    
    Put the sample input into `1.in`. The makefile will take that as std input.

    Type `make`, your source file will be compiled to executable, and 
    automatically run with 1.in file, finally the executable to be deleted.

    Then You can see the output on screen, just type make.
