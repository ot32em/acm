# Center of Masses 

## Brief
Find out the center of masses of a convex polygon.

## Input 

A series of convex polygons, defined as a number n ($n <= 100$) stating the number of points of the polygon, followed by n different pairs of integers (in no particular order), denoting the x and y coordinates of each point. The input is finished by a fake ``polygon" with m (m < 3) points, which should not be processed.

## Output 

For each polygon, a single line with the coordinates x and y of the center of masses of that polygon, rounded to three decimal digits.
